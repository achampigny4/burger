## Description

Burgers and Brew is a spooky restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to devour. ​ Whenever a user creates and incantation of a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
​
Every burger is stored in a database, whether devoured or not.
​
Burgers can be deleted from the database.
